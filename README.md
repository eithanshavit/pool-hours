- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Web Scraping**: Axios, Cheerio
- **Time Handling**: Moment.js with timezone support
- **Deployment**: Vercel (recommended)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pool-hours-app.git
cd pool-hours-app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Building for Production

```bash

```

## How It Works

The application works by:

1. **Web Scraping**: The API route (`/api/pool-hours`) scrapes the official Highlands Recreation District website
2. **Data Parsing**: Extracts lap swim and recreational swim hours from HTML tables
3. **Time Processing**: Converts human-readable times to machine-readable timestamps
4. **Status Calculation**: Determines if the pool is currently open based on current time
5. **UI Display**: Presents the information in a user-friendly interface

## API Endpoint

The app provides a REST API endpoint:

- **GET** `/api/pool-hours`
- **Response**: JSON object containing pool hours, current status, and metadata

Example response:
```json
{
  "hours": [
    {
      "start": "2024-01-15T07:30:00.000Z",
      "end": "2024-01-15T11:00:00.000Z",
      "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
      "original": "7:30am - 11:00am",
      "type": "lap"
    }
  ],
  "prettified": "[Open] Lap 7:30am-11:00am / Rec 1:00pm-5:00pm",
  "isOpenNow": true,
  "error": null,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```
