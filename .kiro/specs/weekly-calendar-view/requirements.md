# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the existing pool hours application by adding a weekly calendar view that displays pool schedules for an entire week instead of just the current day. Users will be able to see lap swim and recreational swim hours across multiple days in a comprehensive weekly layout, making it easier to plan their pool visits in advance.

## Requirements

2. WHEN displaying the weekly view THEN the system SHALL show both lap swim and recreational swim hours for each day
3. WHEN displaying the weekly view THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between lap swim and recreational swim sessions using visual indicators
4. WHEN displaying the weekly view THEN the system SHALL highlight the current day to help users orient themselves
5. WHEN displaying the weekly view THEN the system SHALL show day names (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for each day in the week

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a pool visitor, I want to easily switch between daily and weekly views, so that I can choose the level of detail that best suits my current needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is in daily view THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to switch to weekly view
2. WHEN the user is in weekly view THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to switch back to daily view
3. WHEN switching between views THEN the system SHALL maintain the current date context
4. WHEN switching views THEN the system SHALL preserve any loading or error states appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a pool visitor, I want the weekly view to show current time indicators, so that I can quickly identify what's happening now and what's coming next across the week.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the weekly calendar THEN the system SHALL highlight currently active pool sessions across all visible days
2. WHEN viewing the weekly calendar THEN the system SHALL indicate upcoming sessions for the current day
3. WHEN displaying time slots THEN the system SHALL show times in the user's local timezone
4. WHEN a pool session is currently active THEN the system SHALL visually emphasize that session in the weekly view

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a pool visitor, I want the weekly view to be responsive and readable on mobile devices, so that I can check pool schedules on my phone while on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the weekly calendar on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display the information in a readable format
2. WHEN the screen size is limited THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout to fit the available space
3. WHEN displaying the weekly view THEN the system SHALL maintain good contrast and readability
4. WHEN interacting with the weekly view on touch devices THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate touch targets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a pool visitor, I want to navigate between this week and next week, so that I can plan my swimming schedule for upcoming weeks in advance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is viewing the weekly calendar THEN the system SHALL provide navigation controls to switch between "This Week" and "Next Week"
2. WHEN the user selects "This Week" THEN the system SHALL display the current week (Monday to Sunday containing today's date)
3. WHEN the user selects "Next Week" THEN the system SHALL display the following week (Monday to Sunday of the week after the current week)
4. WHEN viewing "Next Week" THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that this is next week's schedule
5. WHEN switching between weeks THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual layout and functionality
6. WHEN viewing future weeks THEN the system SHALL not show "current" or "next" session indicators since those are time-based

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a pool visitor, I want the weekly view to handle data loading and errors gracefully, so that I have a consistent experience even when there are connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the weekly view is loading data THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
2. WHEN there are network errors THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages in the weekly view
3. WHEN some days have no pool hours data THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which days are unavailable
